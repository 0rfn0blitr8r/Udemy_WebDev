FROM CODESANDBOX DIRECTORY:
	in index.js, App.js is imported and
	the id of 'root' is identified as 'rootElement' 
	from the index.html file

	now this rootElement is created as 'Root' and the stuff in App.js is 
	rendered into the html file through it.

In writing JSX components, all you have to do is write a 
js function with name capitalized and return a 'html-esque' stuff

making Local Apps using Vite and React: 
	Vite is like 'maven' to a react project | ofc it helps in other frameworks as well

	in a dir, To make a Vite Project: 
		open dir in terminal & run <npm create vite@latest>
			then enter the Project name and package name based on the project
			then enter one of the supported frameworks
		change dir to that project and run <npm i> to finish installing the remaining dependencies

	To run: <npm run dev>

NOTE: for a ReactJS app, we can also use Create-React-App //create-react-app
