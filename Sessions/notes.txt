it ain't practical to store a lot of data client-side using cookies
this is where sessions comes in

sessions are server-side data store that we use to make HTTP stateful
instead of storing data using cookies, we store data server-side and 
give browser a cookie which acts as a key to access data from the server	
	eg: session-id

default Memory storage setup is MemoryStore
	which is definitely not deployable

So, we need make a database which can store a complete session 
	without memory leakage

resave is a val default to be true
	it makes session's data to be stored(refreshed) even 
	if it is not modified in a session

saveUninitialized: enables a session to be saved when it is new but not modified
	choosing val to be false is beneficial in login sessions
	false also helps in tackling a race condition where user makes multiple
	parallel requests without a session
